# twitch-tv
Project for freeCodeCamp's front-end certification. The goal of the project is to make multiple JSON API calls
to twitch.tv and display a user's followers list, links to their feeds, and activity status. I also included
the ability to toggle between feed status by online, offline, or all followers.
